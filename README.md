## Features

- **Draw Lines:** Measure features on an image.
- **Pixel Measurements:** Determine sizes in pixels.
- **Real-World Units:** Measure in real units for scanned images with a known DPI.
- **Relative Measurements:** Compare sizes relative to a reference object.
- **Local/Offline Use:** Images are processed locally; no data is sent to servers.

## How to Use

1. **Load an Image:** Upload your image.
2. **Set Reference Size:** Click "Add Reference Size," then set the start and end points. Enter the length and unit.
3. **Input DPI:** Enter DPI if known to scale measurements accurately.
4. **Add Measurement Lines:** Click "New Measurement Line" to draw lines.
5. **Adjust or Remove:** Drag handles to adjust lines, or click "✖" to remove them.

### Important

**Understanding Perspective:** If you're measuring from photos taken with a camera, keep in mind that perspective can affect accuracy. Measurements will be correct only if the objects and the reference line are on the same flat surface and at the same distance from the camera. Avoid using reference lines on objects that are angled, tilted, or on different depth planes, as this will distort the measurements. Imagine how things look smaller when they're farther away — the same happens in photos! To get accurate results, ensure everything is flat and aligned with the camera lens.
